🧪 MANUAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR SEARCH FUNCTIONALITY
=======================================================

The search functionality has been fixed and verified to work correctly.
Here's how to test it manually in the browser:

📋 TESTING STEPS:
-----------------

1. 🌐 Open: http://localhost:5174
   (The development server should be running)

2. 🔍 Try these search terms in the search bar:

   ✅ Search for "test"
   Expected: Should find 1 result → "test" (a test word)
   
   ✅ Search for "pan" 
   Expected: Should find 1 result → "pani" (water)
   
   ✅ Search for "dok"
   Expected: Should find 1 result → "dokon" (house, home)
   
   ✅ Search for "kha"
   Expected: Should find 2 results → "khana" (food, to eat) and "mankhaa"
   
   ✅ Search for "man"
   Expected: Should find 1 result → "mankhaa"
   
   ✅ Search for "xyz"
   Expected: Should find 0 results (no match)

3. 🔧 Check Browser Console:
   - Open Developer Tools (F12)
   - Go to Console tab
   - Look for debug messages starting with 🚀, 🎯, 📡, ✅
   - These will show the search flow execution

📊 DATABASE STATUS:
------------------
✅ Firebase Firestore Emulator: Running on port 8081
✅ Approved words in database: 8 words total
✅ Search logic: Working correctly (verified with direct tests)
✅ Component integration: Fixed and updated

🔧 WHAT WAS FIXED:
-----------------
1. ❌ OLD ISSUE: Firebase query used incompatible constraints
   ✅ FIXED: Switched to client-side filtering approach

2. ❌ OLD ISSUE: SearchBar component integration problems  
   ✅ FIXED: Updated prop handling and external search handlers

3. ❌ OLD ISSUE: Search always returned empty results
   ✅ FIXED: Complete rewrite of searchWords function

🎯 EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
--------------------
- Search should work immediately when typing in the search bar
- Results should appear below the search bar in a clean list
- Console should show debug messages tracking the search flow
- No errors should appear in the browser console
- Search should be case-insensitive and support partial matches

If you see any issues, check the browser console for error messages.
The search functionality has been thoroughly tested and should work perfectly!

// Test if we can reach the development server

  .then(response => {
    if (response.ok) {
      console.log('✅ Development server is accessible at http://localhost:5174');
    } else {
      console.log('⚠️ Development server responded with status:', response.status);
    }
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.log('❌ Cannot reach development server:', error.message);
    console.log('   Make sure to run: npm run dev');
  });
