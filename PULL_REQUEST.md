# XState Word Review System Implementation

## Summary

This PR adds a state machine implementation using XState to manage the word review workflow in the Kurukh Dictionary application. This improvement brings a more structured, predictable approach to managing the complex word review process, making it easier to understand, maintain, and extend.

## Key Changes

1. **State Machine Definition**
   - Created a formal state machine definition in `wordReviewMachine.js`
   - Defined all possible states, events, and transitions
   - Added actions to track state history and metadata

2. **Firebase Integration**
   - Implemented a service layer in `wordReviewService.js` to map between state machine states and Firestore
   - Added methods to transition words through review states
   - Ensured proper history tracking for auditing purposes

3. **React Integration**
   - Created a custom hook `useWordReview.js` for React components
   - Integrated the state machine with Admin page for approvals/rejections
   - Added a review status component for word details page

4. **Visualization and Documentation**
   - Added a state machine visualization component
   - Created an SVG diagram for the state flow
   - Added detailed documentation in `/docs/XSTATE_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
   - Updated README.md with information about the state machine

5. **Testing**
   - Added initial tests for the word review service

## Benefits

- **Predictable Behavior**: State transitions are explicitly defined and validated
- **Better Developer Experience**: The flow is clearly visualized and documented
- **Improved Error Handling**: Invalid transitions are prevented by design
- **Separation of Concerns**: Business logic is separated from UI components
- **Maintainability**: Easier to extend and modify the review process
- **Auditability**: Full history of state transitions is recorded

## Next Steps

- Add more comprehensive tests for the state machine
- Implement real-time updates with Firestore listeners
- Enhance the visualization with interactive elements
- Add metrics and analytics based on the state machine
